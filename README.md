### Installation of tkinter
for python 2-D game a python module tkinter is available

Generally tkinter is inbuilt in every python installation.But still if it's not there then:-

for installing in linux:-

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`

if your python version is less than 3.0 then write Tkinter in place of tkinter
and do this :-

`sudo apt-get install python-tk`
